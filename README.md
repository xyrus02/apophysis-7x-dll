# Apophysis 7x DLL renderer
This library exposes the renderer of Apophysis 7x using DLL exports so it can be integrated in other ecosystems. 
This is a rather hacky solution which has been chosen to avoid a tedious and probably pointless translation of Apophysis
into a more integrative (and not completely dead) language.

This source code will not be maintained and using it happens at your own risk. 

Please see https://github.com/xyrus02/apophysis-7x for the full application which probably won't be maintained much either :-)
